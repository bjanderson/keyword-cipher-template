# Keyword Cipher

The keyword cipher is an excellent first program to write in any programming language.

It's a simple algorithm that is easy to remember (at least once you've written it a few times), and you should be able to write the complete program in one sitting.

It also includes most of the fundamental concepts of programming that will introduce you to the basics of a given programming language, such as:

- string manipulation
- array manipulation
- comparisons
- conditionals
- loops
- functions
- how to get inputs to the program, and give outputs from the program
- and, of course, how to execute a working program

You can see a simple explanation of the algorithm in the included [html file](keyword-cipher-algorithm.sozi.html). It is a slide show, and you can advance the slides by clicking on them, or drag from side to side.

Once you have the basic program working, try experimenting with different forms of inputs and outputs, such as:

- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- File System
- perhaps even databases, servers, logs, etc...

You can also try to implement the algorithm in different ways, using different features of the programming language.

- try replacing for loops with forEach loops
- try replacing array assignments with array mapping
- try replacing hard-coded alphabets with programatically generated alphabets, using ascii values for example.

Remember, the point is to learn the programming language, not struggle with a difficult problem that needs to be solved.

Have fun with it!
